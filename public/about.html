<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Problem Solver, Dedicated Educator, Writer, and Servant of YHWH <br />
  With a proven track record of mentoring and inspiring young people in their faith journeys,<br />
  I am a passionate educator and writer committed to serving YHWH.<br />
  My experience in guiding God-fearing youths has fostered a deep understanding of their unique needs and aspirations.
</p>

<p>As a dedicated servant of YHWH, I am driven to explore the intersection of faith and technology.<br />
  I believe that these two powerful forces can be harnessed to spread the message of hope and love to a wider audience.

<p>My goal is to leverage my skills and experience to make a positive impact on the world by reflecting Christ and His interests in all that I do.<br />
  I am committed to using my passion, wisdom, and faith to guide others towards a life of love, peace, and growth.<br />
